# blob-breaker
This project was made for teaching purposes. It was suppose to be simple enough to understand and easy enough to learn. Although this project was never used for what it was made for because I had to withdraw from teaching it due to certain circumstances. So I decided to upload it here on Itch. This game was made with C++ and SFML library for PCs on Windows.
